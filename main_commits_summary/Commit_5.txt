# Summary - Priority Queue for transaction scheduling

## What This Commit Adds
Transactions often compete for execution priority.  
In this commit:

- Each transaction now has a fee and timestamp.
- A priority queue orders ready transactions by:
  1. Higher fee first  
  2. If fee ties → earlier timestamp first  
- Parallel batches now execute in miner-like order.
