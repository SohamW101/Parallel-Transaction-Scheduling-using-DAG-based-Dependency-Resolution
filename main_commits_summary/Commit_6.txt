# Commit 6 — Thread Pool Integration

## What This Commit Adds
Instead of creating a new thread for each transaction, we now use a fixed-size **ThreadPool**.

### Benefits:
- Reuses threads
- Avoids thread creation overhead
- Scales to thousands of transactions
- Realistic for blockchain VMs and validators
