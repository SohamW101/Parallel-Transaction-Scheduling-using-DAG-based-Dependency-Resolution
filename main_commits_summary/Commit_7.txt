# Summary - Commit 7 — Global State Representation

## What this commit adds
- A `State` class (simple key -> balance map).
- Transactions evaluated in parallel per batch to compute *local deltas*.
- After each batch evaluation, deltas merged sequentially into the global `State`.
- ThreadPool improved to track active tasks to allow correct batch waiting.
