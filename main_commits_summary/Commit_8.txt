# Commit 8 — Conflict Detection & Safe Parallel State Updates

## What changed
- Batches are partitioned into conflict-free groups before parallel evaluation.
- Conflict rules used:
  - A.write ∩ B.read  => conflict
  - A.write ∩ B.write => conflict
  - A.read  ∩ B.write => conflict
- Each group is evaluated in parallel; group deltas are merged atomically into global state.
- This avoids concurrent conflicting writes/reads without requiring fine-grained locks.
