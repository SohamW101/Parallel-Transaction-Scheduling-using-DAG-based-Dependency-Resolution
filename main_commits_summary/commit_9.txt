- Per-batch execution time
- Per-group execution time
- Number of batches
- Number of groups in each batch

All logs are written to **metrics.log**.

## New classes
### Metrics
Handles:
- High-resolution timing  
- Logging
- Measuring durations of lambdas

## Why this is important
This commit enables you to show:
- Parallel speedup
- Batch distribution
- Performance correctness
- Efficient thread pool usage
